# Time-Line-App---Data-Art-Task
Stage-1 : static skeleton
->A <header> with logo and theme toggle
->A <nav> or container for filters/placeholders (empty for now) 
->A <section id="timeline"> where event markers will live 
->An empty <div id="modal"> for future popâ€‘ups
->Semantic tags for main content (<main>, <article>, <figure>, etc.)
->No dynamic functionality or styling is included . This sets the stage for future development in Stage 2.
